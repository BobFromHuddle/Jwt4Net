Jwt4Net is a C# library for issuing and consuming JWT tokens.

It offers strongly typed token values, and simple model for issuance and consumption.

The library is currently dependent on a bunch of third-party libraries, but I hope to replace those over time.

The library is currently compatible with draft 1 of the JWT spec, and supports ECC tokens.

As the specification matures, the library will keep up to date with changes, with the aim of fully supporting a ratified JWT proposal.
